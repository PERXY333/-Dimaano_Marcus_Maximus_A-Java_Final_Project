Sustainable Development Goal 15: Life on Land aims to protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, halt deforestation, combat desertification, and halt biodiversity loss. 
This goal is directly relevant to terreSTRIAL, a platform for trading and selling plants.
As the project involves plant commerce, it must address environmental sustainability and promote practices that align with SDG 15. 
If poorly managed, such a platform could contribute to habitat destruction, the spread of invasive species, or the illegal trade of endangered plants, all of which conflict with the goal's objectives.
